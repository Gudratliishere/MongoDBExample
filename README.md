# MongoDB Example Project

This is a simple project that demonstrates the usage of MongoDB with Docker. It provides a basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for a sample collection.

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure that you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

- Docker: [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- Docker Compose: [Install Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/Gudratliishere/MongoDBExample.git
   ```

2. Change into the project directory:

   ```shell
   cd MongoDBExample
   ```

3. Start the MongoDB container using Docker Compose:

   ```shell
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

   This command will download the necessary Docker images and start the MongoDB container in the background.

4. Build and run the application:

5. Access the application:

   Open your web browser and navigate to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) to access the application. You will see a simple web interface with options to create, read data from the MongoDB collection.

6. Clean up:

   To stop and remove the MongoDB container, run the following command:

   ```shell
   docker-compose down
   ```

   This command will stop and remove the Docker container created for MongoDB.
